# Data Preprocessing 

## Importing Data

```{r}
red_wine <- read.csv("winequality-red", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
red_wine["type"] = 1
head(red_wine)
```


```{r}
white_wine <- read.csv("winequality-white", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
white_wine["type"] = 0
head(white_wine)
```

```{r}
wine <- bind_rows(red_wine, white_wine)
head(wine)
```


# Data Exploration

## Plots

```{r}
plot(wine$total.sulfur.dioxide, jitter(wine$type)) # can tell there is a difference
#view(cor(wine))
```

```{r}
plot(wine$chlorides, jitter(wine$type))
```

```{r}
plot(wine$alcohol, wine$density)
wo_outlier <- wine[wine["density"] < 1.01,]
plot(wo_outlier$alcohol, wo_outlier$density)
wine[wine["density"] > 1.01,]

```

```{r}
# looking at which variables are correlated
cor(wine)
```

Looks like type of wine is highly correlated with serveral predictors. This may mean that it makes sense to look at the quality of the wine just so there are less predictors to deal with. 

## Correlations
```{r}
# treating qulaity as a factor
wine$good <- ifelse(wine$quality > 5, 1, 0)
#View(wine)

# care more about if predictors correlated with this good value
cor(wine)
```

## Summary Statistics
```{r}
summary(wine)
```


# Classification Models

```{r}
# logisitic regression 
log_mod <- glm(good ~ . - quality, data = wine, family = binomial)
summary(log_mod)
```
