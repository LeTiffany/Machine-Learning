## Importing Data

```{r}
red_wine <- read.csv("winequality-red.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
red_wine["type"] = 1
head(red_wine)
```


```{r}
white_wine <- read.csv("winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
white_wine["type"] = 0
head(white_wine)
```

```{r}
wine <- rbind(red_wine, white_wine)
head(wine)
```

# Plots

```{r}
plot(wine$total.sulfur.dioxide, jitter(wine$type), xlab = "Sulfur Dioxide", ylab = "Type") # can tell there is a difference
#view(cor(wine))
```

```{r}
boxplot(wine$total.sulfur.dioxide, wine$type)
```

```{r}
wine[wine[,"total.sulfur.dioxide"] > 400,]
```

```{r}
plot(wine$chlorides, jitter(wine$type), xlab = "Chlorides", ylab = "Type")
```

```{r}
boxplot(wine$chlorides, wine$type)
```

```{r}
wine[wine[, "chlorides"] > 0.6,]
```


```{r}
plot(wine$alcohol, wine$density, xlab = "Alcohol", ylab = "Density")
wo_outlier <- wine[wine["density"] < 1.01,]
plot(wo_outlier$alcohol, wo_outlier$density, xlab = "Alcohol", ylab = "Density")
wine[wine["density"] > 1.01,]
```
